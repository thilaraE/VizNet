sample-n500_bin_cont6700000.txt is just copy of
sample-n500_bin_cont6700000.clu (a single outcome from the ALAAM
simulation detailed below) with first line replaced with attr name,
simiarly for the binary and continuous attribute files, and
n500_kstar_simulate12750000.txt is just the
n500_kstar_simulate1275000_matrix.txt converted to Pajek edgelist
format using igraph in R).

Example for simulating from 500 node network (the n500_kstar_simulate1275000_matrix.txt
network is extracted using extractnetwork.sh script from sample 1275000
of the  /home/projects/pMelb0110/n500_kstar_simulation/ 
networks with parameters Edge=-4, AS=0.2, AT=1.0, A2P=-0.2)
